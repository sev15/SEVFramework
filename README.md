SEV Framework is a DDD-inspired & SOA ready .NET framework for the developement of business applications with N-tier (multilayered) architecture. The SEV Framework follows object-oriented design and supports the following layers :
 - UI Model layer or Presentation layer;
 - Application or Service layer;
 - Business Domain layer (based on the Repository and Unit Of Work patterns, includes Business Domain Model);
 - Data Access layer includes the implementation of the interfaces of the Business Domain layer for the Entity Framework.

The SEV Framework is based on the use of the Dependency Inversion S.O.L.I.D principle. The SEV Framework introduces a generic IoC container IDIContainer. An implementation of the IDIContainer interface for LightInject is provided.
